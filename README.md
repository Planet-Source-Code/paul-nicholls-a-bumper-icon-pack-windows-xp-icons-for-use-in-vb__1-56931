## A Bumper Icon Pack \!\!\! Windows XP Icons for use in VB\!


</div>

### Description

This would appear to be the biggest single collection of Windows icons on the internet. I looked everywhere for versions of the Windows Xp icons that I could use in my VB projects, all over the web and found very little. So I gave up and did it myself. Included in this download are OVER 800 ICONS FILES.

This would appear to be the biggest single collection of Windows icons on the internet. I looked everywhere for versions of the Windows Xp icons that I could use in my VB projects, all over the web and found very little. So I gave up and did it myself. Included in this download are OVER 800 ICONS FILES.
All icons are set up to work within VB. I think I got every Windows XP icon there is, and more. There are toolbar icons matching those used in Outlook Express, IE and Windows Explorer all ready for use in VB. All files are kept to one format per icon - which is how VB likes them. Normally one ico file hold 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48 all in severaldifferent colour resolutions. These icons are all 256 or 16.1M colours which are all VB supports (WinXP uses new 24/32bit alpha - but VB dosn't support this).
There is some code included, but only to demonstrate the icons. Its an image thuimbnail browser, patched together from PSC submissions.
I appreciate this isn't really a 'code' submission however it is undoubtedly of great use to any VB programmer, preparing these icons took *lots* of my time and I would appreciate a little feedback and acknowledgement for my hard work.
If you want more Icons do let me know, these are just most of my Windows XP ones - I have more for ME/98.
I would have posted a screenshot, but thought why? After all we all know what Windows Icons look like.
