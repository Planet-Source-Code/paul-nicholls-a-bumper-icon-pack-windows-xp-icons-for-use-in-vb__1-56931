1. The Point of the Program

   The program isn't the important thing here ... the icons are. I have compiled icons from all 
   over the place for use within VB. The icon files are perfectly suited to VB and add a touch
   of professionalism to a project.

   Most of the icons are from Windows XP, or obey the Windows XP 'style' of icons. These make
   your program look like it was specifically designed for XP .. rather than using the pants
   windows 95 icons that come with VB (6 as least -- I assume the others are the same).

   There are a whole array of icons for virtually everything, i would be very surprised if you
   were looking for a specific icon and couln't find it.
   

2. How to use the Program

   I've put one form in demonstrating the toolbar icons. These are loaded into image lists then
   sent to the toolbars. It all looked fine - then suddenly all the colours inverted and 
   something I don't understand happened. The ico files are all right, it was just that VB did 
   something to the image lists. This is why there is no screenshot becuase the icons all now
   look terrible in the toolbars and i can't be bothered to replace all the toolbars and image
   lists.

   If you have had similar problems (i'm running vb6 on a winXP Prof pc with XP "manifested".)
   please let me know!

   The second form is an image-browser using thumbnails. This is part of a bigger project I
   am workin on; Terabyte 2 and I've just grabbed this one form from it so as to allow you to
   quickly browse the icons enclosed. The thumbnail routine was originally from PSC but I've
   re-written it so many times now I think the credit's hardly worth mentioning.

   The image-browser is probably ful of all kinds of bug, as i had to chop out my custom
   ocxs and 3rd part dlls to keep the size down and not release all my hard work! But, as 
   said above the program is not the point of this submission, its all the icons.

3. The Icons

   There are over 800 icon files included, so if there are three formats for each file
   (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) thats over 250 unique icons! Each ico file (should) contain only
   one icon, this is becuase VB will by default read the first icon in the ico file, while
   windows explorer reads the best matching icon to you view-size and screen-depth and when
   read in a bitmap viewer it is usually the last icon which is loaded --- to avoid all this
   there is only one icon per file. And usually three versions of each file 16,32 & 48.

   All the icons are in either 256 of 24bit (16million colours) quality, XP does support 32bit
   'Alpha' icons but VB DOES NOT. 

   There are also a few of my own icon adaptions included.

   I have included some files from Microsoft which explain how to make XP style icons.
   There is a colour chart shown of the basic colours you should use. If you search on the
   MS website you can find the whole article for yourselves.

   These icons can be used in your own projects (to help people improve their GUIs - something
   a lot of people need to learn to do.), in your own toolbars etc. You cannot use most of 
   these files to customise your windows icons. To do this windows required all the icon 
   formats to be in the same ico file. The only icons you could do this with are my new,
   improved VB icons found in \XP Icons\Mine - which are improved versions of the classes,
   form, module and project icons.

   I've spent a long time collecting all these icons, from various sources. It is a *very*
   time consuming process, and some recognition for this would be nice! If you would like
   the versions of the icon files where all formats are in one file, or any window ME icons
   I have them all too, just e-mail me and I'll send them to you or tell you where you can
   download them from.

4. As far as i am aware, according to something I read on MSDN you can use all of the icons
   in your projects however you want with no copyright restrictions. Its only if the icon
   contains the MS Logo, Flag or other trademarks that you are not allowed to use the icon.

5. If you have comments, problems, queries, etc etc please contact me at either
   vbe_software@yahoo.co.uk, r9paul@hotmail.com or via the PSC site.
